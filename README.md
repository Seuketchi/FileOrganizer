# File Organizer

A simple C program to organize files in a specified directory by sorting them into folders based on their file type extensions (e.g., images, documents, audio, etc.). This program creates folders for each category (e.g., "Images," "Documents") and moves files into their respective folders.

## Features

- **Automatic Categorization**: Sorts files into specific folders based on file extensions.
- **Duplicate File Handling**: Avoids duplicate files by appending a suffix to the filename if necessary.
- **Detailed Summary**: Displays a summary of files moved and errors encountered.

## Folder Structure

Files are organized into these folders:

- **Images**: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `tiff`, `svg`
- **Documents**: `pdf`, `doc`, `docx`, `txt`, `rtf`, `odt`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `ppt`, `pptx`
- **Audio**: `mp3`, `wav`, `wma`, `flac`, `m4a`, `aac`
- **Video**: `mp4`, `avi`, `mkv`, `mov`, `wmv`, `flv`
- **Code**: `py`, `js`, `html`, `css`, `cpp`, `cs`, `java`, `php`
- **Archives**: `zip`, `rar`, `7z`, `tar`, `gz`
- **Others**: Any other file types or files without an extension

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seuketchi/FileOrganizer.git
   cd file-organizer
   ```
2. **Compile the Code**: Use GCC or any C compiler to compile the program:

   ```
3. **Run the Program**:

   ```

## Usage

   - Create necessary folders if they donâ€™t already exist.
